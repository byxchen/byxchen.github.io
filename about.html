						Hi, welcome!
						<br><br>
						My name is Brian Chen and I am a sophomore undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
						<br><br>
						I've been coding since I first took a computer science class in Grade 10, and I haven't looked back. I've done Web Development, Software Engineering,
						Android Development, and Game Development. Some of the projects and other things that I've worked on are avaliable on my GitHub, and on the Projects page
						of this website.
						<br>
						<br>
						I'm absolutely in love with video games. I'm a die hard StarCraft player, both games. I've invested countless hours into League of Legends, too. Now, most of my time
						is going to Overwatch. My passion of games doesn't just end there though - I both like and want to develop games too. I'm currently learning Unity to familiarize myself with the
						program, and I'm also looking to get into Unreal Engine, too. It's a challenge, but it's a fun one.
						<br><br>
						I'm a TV show watcher, too. Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, The Wire, Game of Thrones. If you meet me in real life and start a conversation - I probably won't be able to shut up for the next
						few hours. Fan theories, speculation, and hype -- I'm kind of an addict.

							Created an android application - OneMark - for congregating and summarizing grades pulled from internet
							sources (e.g. Blackboard, Desire to Learn). Instead of Students checking many websites to find out marks, OneMark offers students a program that once given credentials and URLs to websites,
							will collect and consolidate all marks into one application. This app offers ease-of-use, and offers diagnostic breakdowns of marks over time, marks needed to achieve goal grade, and other quality of life features.

						<span style="font-size:12px"><strong>Computer Science Representative (2016), Programming Club Lead (2016)</strong></span>
						<br>
						<p class="desc-text">
							The Association of Mathematical and Computer Science Students (AMACSS) is a Departmental Student Association - a student led organization with a specific academic focus. AMACSS works with
							students in the Computer and Mathematical Sciences stream to help explain key concepts, review for exams, host seminars, and organize networking and gaming events.
							<br>
							<br>
							As a Computer Science Representative, I served as liaison with the executives for all students in the Computer Science Stream at the University of Toronto at Scarborough. I identified concerns from Computer Science students and brought them to the attention of appropriate figures within the association.
							I also organized and hosted several review seminars for midterms. In these review seminars, we covered past midterms, key concepts, as well as potential exam questions.
							<br>
							<br>
							As the Programming Club lead, I managed all relations between AMACSS and the Programming Club (Computer Science Enrichment Club). I ran, organized, promoted, and did all the administrative work to make the two clubs work in sync, 
							whether it be hosting joint socials or sharing opportunities.

						<p class="desc-text">
							The Computer Science Enrichment Club is a student-run club located at the University of Toronto at Scarborough. Our goal is to help Computer Science enthusiasts take the next step in their development as
							problem solvers and creative innovators. We want to develop student’s analytical, algorithmic, and creative thinking skills and help students to learn about applications of computer science outside of university, in
							events such as hackathons or endeavours like personal projects.
							<br>
							<br>
							As the President, I am responsible for all events, logistics, and operations of the club. I manage the finances, plan out the events, communicate with AMACSS, professors, and the Department of Student Life and the
							Scarborough Campus Student's Union to make our club thrive. I also acted as a primary lecturer that created and delivered the content of the organization to its individual members, as well as co-ordinating the other
							executive members. I also wrote the syllabus, constitution, and organized the cirriculum to be covered every semester.

						<strong>Reading:</strong> <br>
						<span style="margin-left:2%">
							I like to read a lot. I usually end up gravitating towards the Fantasy and SciFi genre, though (original, right?)
							Some of my favorite books include the A Song of Ice and Fire series (please release The Winds of Winter already, George), and the Kingkiller Chronicles
							(same with you Patrick, please give me Doors of Stone). I've read a lot of the classics, and if you have a good book suggestion, please
							feel free to tell me via the Google Form in my Contact section.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<strong>Gaming:</strong> <br>
						<span style="margin-left:2%">
							I mean, what Computer Science student doesn't appreciate a good video game? I've been all over the place these past years, jumping from StarCraft II 
							(got Platinum as my highest rank), to League of Legends (currently Platinum). I've played many RPGs, some of my favorites being Mass Effect, the Witcher trilogy,
							and Bioshock Infinite. I've met new friends and explored new worlds in MMORPGs such as RuneScape and Guild Wars (1 & 2). Now, I'm addicted to playing Overwatch, 
							because, as you know, the world needs heroes!
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<strong>Dragon Boating:</strong> <br>
						<span style="margin-left:2%">
							At the beginning of my first year, someone approached me and energetically invited me to join the newly restarted Dragon Boat team at UTSC. I hesitantly accepted, 
							I guess I was curious to see what it was about. Now, I love it! I've found that Dragon Boating is a very fun and intense sport that really pushes each
							individual to realize the importance of sync and teamwork. I've met great friends through my first year with UTSC's Crimson Tide, and I can't wait for what lies ahead.
						</span>
						<br><br>
						<strong>Basketball:</strong> <br>
						<span style="margin-left:2%">
							Go Raptors Go!
							<br>
							Need I say more? We're living in the Golden Age of Toronto basketball. As I write this, the Raptors have just been eliminated from the Eastern Conference Finals by the 
							Cleveland Cavaliers 4-2. Even though they've been eliminated, this is the furthest we've ever gotten in Raptors history. Things are looking up, and it's a great time to be a basketball fan 
							in Toronto.
							<br>
							I play a lot of pickup basketball at the Toronto Pan American Sports Center, as well as following the NBA almost religiously. I'm also in a fantasy basketball league with some of 
							my buddies, which I'm also very passionate about.
