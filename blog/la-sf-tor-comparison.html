					</p>
					Well this took a lot longer to get to than I expected, lol. To say that the past few years were
					interesting is a massive understatement. The pandemic, the lockdowns, the Ukraine-Russia war, and
					the countless other things that happened. What a wild few years. Anyway, back to the topic at hand.
					<br /> <br />
					I've had the chance to live in Toronto (10yr+), San Francisco (1yr), and Los Angeles (2yr). Here are
					my thoughts about each:

					<br /> <br />

					<span class="blog-bold">Toronto</span> - Similar to the New York of Canada, it has amazing social
					diversity, OK transit, lots of amazing restaurants, and a wide array of different people from
					different walks of life. <br /><br />

					<span class="blog-bold">San Francisco</span> - One of the best places to be if you're a tech nerd,
					but social life is severely lacking. The most interesting place in SV, but that's only because
					everything else is incredibly dead. Better weather than Toronto, much better transit.<br /><br />

					<span class="blog-bold">Los Angeles</span> - LA is huge and amaazing, but your experience will
					depend entirely on where exactly you are. It is basically 20+ cities compressed into
					one area. Great diversity, amazing vistas, and some of the best food on the planet. Transportation
					is insanely bad and you basically can't live without a car.<br /><br />

					<p class="blog-subheader">
						<a name="culture">Culture and Safety</a>
					</p>
					<span class="blog-bold">Toronto</span> - Toronto is the melting pot of Canada - there are people
					from all walks of life, all backgrounds, all ethnicities, all professions, etc. You'll never feel
					out of place and you'll be able to experience so much multiculturalism that it'll be a very
					enriching experience for you. There are {culture}-towns for every culture - Chinatown, Koreatown,
					Little Ethiopia, Little Greece, etc.
					<br /><br />
					Toronto is generally safe. There are definitely pockets in Toronto that are less-than-stellar (Jane
					and Finch come to mind), but public safety is never something that I felt was compromised. The
					homeless population is fairly low compared to SF/LA, and are generally reasonable and unaggressive
					people.
					<br /><br />

					<span class="blog-bold">San Francisco</span> - San Francisco has pretty radically different
					neighborhoods for different activities - there is flamboyant Castro, the renown Chinatown, the
					popular Fisherman's Wharf, and the
					busy Financial District. Each neighborhood has its own attractions, culture, and
					activities. Generally a very bright and vibrant community with a fair amount of diversity. The only
					drawback is that most of the young people in SF are in big tech, or work in fields tangential to
					it.<br /><br />
					San Francisco didn't particularlly feel unsafe, but definitely a step down from Toronto. Its
					Metro/MUNI
					systems were often either dirty or commonly people not sound-of-mind (loud, disruptive, aggressive).
					Especially in downtown San Francisco, the gentrification results in a lot of displaced residents and
					homelessness. This is especially bad in SoMa and the Tenderloin. I recommend living in a safe area
					or out in the outskirts of SF (Parkmerced area).
					<br /><br />
					<span class="blog-bold">Los Angeles</span> - LA is a giant area (the Greater Los Angeles Area) that
					encapsulates a TON of cities - Santa Monica, Venice, Culver City, Irvine, etc. Each one of which has
					a very distinct culture, and different attractions. Some notable areas are - Hollywood (celebs),
					Santa Monica (piers), Koreatown (food), Venice (art), and Malibu (beaches). There is a huge
					diversity of professions here - influencers, entertainers, programmers, artists, musicians, etc.
					However, ethnic diversity is a bit lower than SF/TOR - I noticed that the amount of South-Asian and
					East-Asian people were much lower comparatively.
					<br /><br />
					Unfortunately, LA is not that safe in my opinion. The public transportation is very unsafe - tons of
					mentally unsound and aggressive people regularly use the metro and refuse to pay the fares. The bus
					operators are so jaded that they don't even confront these people because the arguements are not
					worth it. I've been harassed multiple times, and mugged once. The homeless population is very high
					in LA, much higher than TOR and somewhat higher than SF. The streets are also not well illuminated
					at night, which results in even more unfortunate situations that happen. Although it is incredibly
					neighborhood dependent (steer clear of Compton, Koreatown), the general level of safety is still
					subpar compared to SF and Toronto.
					<br /><br />

					<p class="blog-subheader">
						<a name="tech">Technology and Career</a>
					</p>
					<span class="blog-bold">Toronto</span> - Toronto has a pretty good diversity of technology companies
					- its been noted that Toronto has one of the fastest growing tech scenes in the world - on par with
					Silicon Valley and Austin/Seattle. Opportunities exist in startups, big banks, fintech, and
					established remote offices for American Big-N companies such as Meta, Google, Salesforce, Snapchat,
					etc.
					<br /><br />
					Toronto's pay is awful. This is generally a Canada problem, but for a city with as high
					cost-of-living as Toronto does, salaries for tech workers massively lag behind cities of comparable
					CoL in the states. In my experience, the salary ranges are something like this, for somewhat
					competitive Software Engineering roles, total compensation in CAD:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">New Grad / Junior</span> - 90-130K CAD</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Mid Level</span> - 100-150K CAD</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Senior</span> - 120-200K CAD</li>
					</ul>

					<span class="blog-bold">San Francisco</span> - SF has an amazing amount of technical diversity -
					startups, major established tech companies, and everything else under the sun. Here, I'm more
					referring to companies thare are in the Bay Area - Redwood City, San Mateo, Mountain View, Menlo
					Park, etc. Incredibly easy to commute between the places due to company busses and CalTrain.
					<br /><br />
					SF and SV is great for career progression - companies usually move fast and promote fast. The faster
					you're promoted, the more you can leapfrog your career. I've seen friends reach E5 (Senior) in 2-3
					years and then leapfrog to a similar company (e.g. Google -> Meta, Meta -> Google) for a huge pay
					bump. It's not interesting to list expected compensation for SF/SV, but it's among the highest in
					the world. You can look at <a class="link nodeco" target="_blank"
						href="https://levels.fyi">levels.fyi</a> for details, but expect something in this range, TC
					USD:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">New Grad / Junior</span> - 130-200K USD</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Mid Level</span> - 180-280K USD</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Senior</span> - 250-400K USD</li>
					</ul>

					<span class="blog-bold">Los Angeles</span> - LA has a pretty interesting tech landscape - mainly
					dominated by a
					few big companies satellite campuses (Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Uber) as well as a fair few
					entertainment companies (Riot Games, Sony, Blizzard, Hulu, Netflix, etc.).
					<br /><br />
					Although LA isn't a city dominated by tech, there are still a great amount of high-paying tech
					companies in LA. Also by virtue of being close to SF, in California, and in the states, it shares
					similar compensation ranges to SF. You can also leapfrog around the big companies to get notable pay
					bumps, or leap to one of the many startups in the LA area too. Estimations for salaries are slightly
					lower for LA than SF, but still high compared to TOR.
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">New Grad / Junior</span> - 100-170K USD</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Mid Level</span> - 130-240K USD</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Senior</span> - 170-300K USD</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="blog-subheader">
						<a name="play">Activities and Transportation</a>
					</p>
					<span class="blog-bold">Toronto</span> - Toronto is probably the best place to be in Canada, and one
					of the best East-Coast cities for entertainment. From plays to music festivals to sports events,
					Toronto is up there with NYC, Seattle, and LA as major destinations for big events. Toronto has a
					great amount of museums, escape rooms, sports recreation, and parks. It does lack some hiking and
					ski/snowboarding compared to LA/SF, which you'll need to drive a fair bit out to experience.
					<br /><br />
					Getting around in Toronto is doable without a car, but it's still recommended. The bus system (TTC)
					is cheap and convenient but often late, crowded, and unreliable. The light rail system is being
					deprecated, and Uber/Lyft is pretty expensive.
					<br /><br />

					<span class="blog-bold">San Francisco</span> - San Francisco isn't quite as lively as TOR/LA, but it
					definitely still has a lot of fun things to do. There are aquariums, amazing hikes/forests, ferry
					rides, and a lot of cultural heritage (Fishermans Wharf, Castro, Chinatown). There are also a few
					good music festivals, and a few great resort locations closeby (Tahoe). Also, of course, the
					Warriors!
					<br /><br />
					SF probably had (unpopular opinion) the best local transport of the three cities. The MUNI was a lot
					more reliable (although older), and the CalTrain was fast and cheap. Uber/Lyft adoption is prolific
					and taking rideshares (especially Uber Pool) is both cheap and fast. SF is pretty compact, so the
					sprawl problem that Toronto and LA has isn't quite as prevalent here.

					<p class="blog-subheader">
						<a name="food">Food and Cuisine</a>
					</p>
					<span class="blog-bold">Toronto</span> - Toronto has amazing food - East Asian, African, Middle
					Eastern, South American, European, etc. You may have to venture out to Scarborough for some great
					ethnic food, but the diversity and prolificness of food in Toronto is definitely one of its strong
					points.
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Xiaolongkan Chinese Fondue</span> - Great hotpot with unique vibes
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Gyubee Japanese Grill </span> - Japanese BBQ with great dipping
							sauce and meat selection </li>

							hole-in-the-wall Greek restaurant that serves huge portions of succulent chicken, potato,
							salad, feta, and rice with an amazing sauce.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<span class="blog-bold">San Francisco</span> - While San Francisco has a good amount of restaurant
					diversity, I found that it was especially great for Cali/Mex style foods. I heavily recommend trying
					seafood, Mexican food, and the historical Chinatown restaurants.
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Taqueria El Farolito </span> - Best Burrito in SF imo
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Sam Wo Restaurant </span> - Classic heritage Chinese BBQ </li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Mensho SF</span> - Amazing creamy Ramen with great broth</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Hall of Flame Burgers</span> - A wayside burger joint with awesome
							and juicy bacon+avocado burgers

							fresh food
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Salt & Straw</span> - Unique high-quality ice cream with crazy
							seasonal flavors
						</li>
					</ul>

					<span class="blog-bold">Los Angeles</span> - can't possibly describe how many amazing restaurants
					and cuisine experiences there are to explore in SF. I'll list some of my top contenders, but you've
					gotta find out what you like for yourself. These are all pretty far from each other, but all very
					much worth the trek.
					<ul>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Bestia </span> - Modern Italian cuisine with great pasta and bone
							marrow
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> UOVO / Sugarfish / Hi-Ho Cheeseburger </span> - Three amazing
							chains for Italian, Japanese, and American food respectively. Very high quality for
							reasonable prices. </li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Wanderlust Creamery </span> - Quality ice cream focusing on
							East-Asian inspired unique flavors
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold"> Vespertine / Destroyer</span> - Amazing taco truck that specializes
							in seafood offerings, featuring unique octopus taco/torta
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Mariscos Jalisco</span> - Amazing Japanese Omakase with great vibes
							and
							fresh food
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Fugetsu-Do</span> - Renown Japanese mochi shop that has tons of
							great flavors and cute shapes
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">Quality Seafood</span> - Redondo beach joint serving up fresh raw or
							cooked seafood - tons of different Oysters, Clams, Fish&Chips, Chowder, Shrimps, and fresh
							Uni
						</li>
						<li><span class="blog-bold">KBBQ</span> - too many great restaurants to list. Heavily suggest
							checking out: Hae Jong Chong (AYCE), Kang Ho Dong (a La Carte) and Quarters (unique). No
							wrong choices here.
						</li>
					</ul>
