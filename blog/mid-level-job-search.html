                    I just recently wrapped up a job search after deciding to leave Riot Games and take the <a

                    option. Primarily, it was a decision made because of Riot's remote policy and forced
                    return-to-office. Although, being honest, I was interested in how hot the market supposedly was for
                    developers with experience. I made a <a class="link nodeco"
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/t0uhe3/my_job_search_experience_with_2_yoe_as_a_backend/"
                        target="_blank">reddit post about my experiences</a>. Here, I hope to summarize that post and
                    share some more insights.
                    <br /> <br />
                    My experience (Jan - Mar 2022) as a backend-focused Software Engineer with 2 years of full-time
                    experience (3 if you
                    count internships) was that the tech market is hiring like mad. Although the hiring bar isn't lower,
                    the amount of interviews and opportunities are much higher than when I was an intern or a new grad.

                        <a name="prep">Preparing for Interviews</a>
                    </p>
                    I think the worst part of preparing for software engineering interviews is how different it is from
                    the day-to-day job. I've never had to worry about writing trivial algorithms and finding the
                    gotcha-tricks to reduce complexity to linear time. I had to re-learn a lot of the stuff that I
                    forgot over the last few years on the job.
                    <br /><br />
                    First, leetcode -- I hate leetcode. So I didn't grind leetcode, but instead I did about 20 easy/med
                    leetcodes from the
                    infamous <a
                        href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions"
                        target="_blank" class="link nodeco">Blind 75 list</a>.
                    Why didn't I do hundreds of questions? I thought that once I had a good grasp of algorithm
                    fundamentals and understood when/how to use data structures, I had all the tools to solve most
                    leetcode problems. The hard leetcode questions were either logical extensions of the mediums (which
                    would be fine), or so out-of-left-field that I couldn't possibly prepare for them. It felt like
                    diminshing returns to do hundreds of leetcode problems in the chance that I'll be given a really
                    hard question that I've just by chance solved before, so I just didn't.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I also made sure that I meticulously studied Python - how to use it, how to write
                    Pythonic code, shortcuts, tools, stdlibs, and wrote out all the useful algos (BFS, DFS, etc.) in
                    Python so I could formalize my understanding. I literally just made a bunch of small python files to
                    practice stuff. Just what I felt was useful to get a base understanding of how to program live in
                    interview without worrying about syntax
                    <ul>
                        <li>list indexing e.g. [1:] vs [:1] vs [-1] vs [:] - how to use
                            it, what shortcuts exist,

                            copies</li>
                        <li>
                            graph traversals/matrix traversals/BFS/DFS impls

                        <li>
                            python list comprehension

                        <li>
                            python functional programming (map/reduce/filter/lambda/etc.)
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            python std lib stuff like json parsing, making http requests, etc
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    For systems design, I read through the <a
                        href="https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/blob/master/books/designing-data-intensive-applications.md"
                        target="_blank" class="link nodeco">Designing Data Intensive Applications Summary</a>. Since I
                    already worked with highly distributed and data-intensive systems at work, this was a lot easier
                    for
                    me to digest than I thought. I watched a few systems designs interviews on YouTube, and
                    practiced
                    with a few friends. The cheat codes here are: event-driven architecture (async), autoscaling,
                    loadbalancing, trading consistency for consensus, and caches. Learn them and learn them well.

                    I usually applied to mid-level Software Engineer roles. I started looking pretty casually in early
                    January after hearing about how hot the market is. I only applied to companies that I was interested
                    in working for (product-wise), had a referral for, or thought that they paid a lot (lol). I got
                    approximately a 60-70% callback rate on my resume, which I was surprised by. I was also rejected
                    immediately by a few companies - Instacart, Slack, Dropbox, Stripe, and Plaid.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I looked for companies that allowed remote opportunities. Most of them either specified Remote (US)
                    or just Remote. I applied to the job listings that just said Remote -- usually meaning US + Canada.
                    In the HR screen, I made sure to ask the
                    recruiter whether Canada was an option, and it usually was. Some of them did tell me that working
                    from Canada means market-adjusted rates (read: much lower than the US). I typically just cancelled
                    the interview there if they said that to me. I found companies to apply to primarily by:
                    companies to apply to:

                    Below I've included the interview loops with a few of the companies I interviewed with
                    (non-exhaustive). I have a few reasons, thoughts, and data points for each company.
                    <br /><br />
                    The interview process was fairly standard for basically every place I applied to. You could break
                    them down into the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="blog-bold">Craft Screen</span> - refers to a phone/video interview about
                            technical problems. Usually leetcode </li>
                        <li><span class="blog-bold">HR Screen</span> - basically just an expectations call, not really a
                            screen - just discussing w/recruiter about
                            past experience, company culture and vision, and salary expectations </li>
                        <li><span class="blog-bold">Hiring Manager</span> - dives into past technical projects, teamwork
                            and collaboration,
                            professional experience, and information about the role </li>
                        <li><span class="blog-bold">Breadth/Depth Screen</span> - either a wide (breadth) interview
                            about the different tech that
                            you've worked with (e.g. tell me how the internet works), or a deep (depth) dive into your
                            domain knowledge -- e.g. specifics of a language, or how to solve a intricate db consensus

                                I had offers, they all of a sudden said they could definitely come close to 215K TC.
                                Indicated I'd be levelled as a mid-level most likely (despite not doing their onsite
                                yet), and that offer would be less than 140K TC. Overall a bad experience.</td>

                                unfortunately. I went through the whole MSFT loop without talking in-person to one
                                recruiter, and I had to constantly ask "where am I in the process". They would book
                                interviews without telling me what to expect (HR screen? Tech? Sys Design?) and had to
                                reschedule my interviews over 5 times. People were constantly late to my interviews as
                                well. Overall poor experience. Didn't even congratulate when moving onto the next round,
                                just robotically asked for next availibilities.</td>

                    I had a couple of offers but ultimately wanted to end up at Reddit, so I started
                    negotiating. I heavily recommend reading this <a
                        href="https://haseebq.com/my-ten-rules-for-negotiating-a-job-offer/" class="link nodeco"
                        target="_blank">negotiation guide</a>. I ended up negotiating their offer
                    up by approx 33%~ by contrasting with my other offers (and I did really well on the interview loops,
                    so leveraged my performance there as well). The overall total compensation was much
                    higher than I expected to make in Canada, and pretty much in-line with my compensation at Riot Games
                    (which paid market-rate high CoL USD salary already).
                    I'm very happy with that and I chose to
                    accept the offer, and let the other
                    companies know I've made my decision. I realize I'm incredibly lucky to be here, and feel a
                    lot of gratitude to everyone thats helped me along the way.
                    <br /><br />
                    Job market is insane right now. If you aren't happy at your role, please do yourself a service and
                    apply. Even if you're happy, send off an application biweekly and see if you can find any
                    interesting opportunities. This was a lot easier than the job searches as
                    an intern or a new grad, since I already had some experience under my belt and a ton of
                    transferrable skills. Another dimension is that I had a safety nest where I wasn't desparate for a
                    job - I could walk away from interviews, I could bomb interviews, I could reject interviews, and I
                    would know that I'm in comfortable enough a space to not stress over that. This gave me incredible
                    peace-of-mind and helped reduce the stress that interviews usually gave me. I didn't really realize
                    the demand for mid-level (or even, early-career)
                    developers like myself until I put myself out there.
                    <br /><br />
                    Overall, it was a neat experience. Lots of learning and studying, lots of mock interviews, l
                    lots of failed and successful interviews, lots
                    of noticing red-flags during the interview process, and lots of reflection and deliberation. I hope
                    I made the right choice, and am very excited to join Reddit for my next role!
