Quiz Topic: Drawing Squares Recursively

We took a look at various ways to implement Binary Search.
-----------------------------------------------------
Binary Search
-----------------------------------------------------
Remember that Binary Search basically says that:
Given a sorted list, if we want to find an element, we can query from the middle and based on if that term is larger or smaller, we can half the list. That means we only need (log n) where n is the number of elements in the list comparisons to find our element in the worst case.

So for example, we're looking for 2.
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] List
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  9  Index
	   ^ Look At
2 < 5, so we take the left sublist List[:5]
[1,2,3,4,5,6] List
 0 1 2 3 4 5  Index
     ^ Look At
2 < 3 so we take the left sublist again List[:2]
[1,2,3] List
 0 1 2  Index
   ^ Look at
2 = 2 so we have found our element.
-----------------------------------------------------
We took a look at four different recursive ways to implement Binary Search:

def binary_search(L, s):
    '''(list) -> bool
    Return True iff s is an element of L
    REQ: L must be a sorted list
    '''
    # BASE CASE: If L is empty, it's not in the list
    if(len(L) == 0):
        result = False
    # RECURSIVE DECOMP: Pick the middle element, if we found
    # what we're looking for, great. If not, then we've at
    # least cut the list in half
    else:
        # get the middle element of the list
        mid_index = len(L) // 2
        mid_element = L[mid_index]
        # if we found it, then we can stop
        if(mid_element == s):
            result = True
        # if we didn't find it, then see whether we need to continue searching
        # in the left side of the list, or the right
        elif(mid_element < s):
            result = binary_search(L[mid_index + 1:], s)
        else:
            result = binary_search(L[: mid_index], s)

    return result


def binary_search2(L, s):
    '''(list of float) -> int
    Return the index of s in the list L, or -1 if s is not in L
    REQ: L must be a sorted list
    '''

    # BASE CASE: If L is empty, return -1
    if(L == []):
        result = -1
    else:
        # GENERAL CASE
        # get the middle value of L, if it's larger than s, then s must be in
        # the first half of the list, so call binary_search on the first half,
        # otherwise, call it on the second half of L, if it's equal to s, then
        # we've found s and we can stop
        mid_index = len(L)//2
        mid = L[mid_index]
        if(mid == s):
            # found it. return its index
            result = (mid_index)
        elif(mid > s):
            # if s is in L, it must be in the first half of the list
            # so just perform a binary search on the first half of the list
            # and return that search's result
            result = binary_search2(L[0:mid_index], s)
        else:
            # if s is in L, it must be in the latter half of the list
            # so perform a binary search on the latter half of the list,
            # however, this time, if we do get a result, we have to return
            # its offset from our current midpoint
            result = binary_search2(L[mid_index+1:], s)
            # if we didn't find it, just pass on the -1, but if we did
            # we have to add the index in the right list to the index of
            # our middle element to get its index in our list
            if(result != -1):
