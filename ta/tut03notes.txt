We reviewed the idea of Linked Lists
Quiz Topic: Representational Invariants of an Alternating Queue
-------------------------------------------------------
Linked Lists
-------------------------------------------------------
A type of list structure that is defined by Linked List Nodes (LLNodes). Imagine a node that has two things: a value, and a pointer to the next node. These would form a 'line' or a 'string' of linked list nodes, or a linked list.

A LLNode by itself looks like this:
[Value]--->None
An example of a linked list is:
 v The 'Head' LLNode		      v The 'Tail' LLNode
[3]--->[4]--->[1]--->[10]--->[12]--->[15]--->None
    ^ Pointer to next Node		      ^ Last node always points to None to indicate end of Linked list.
-------------------------------------------------------

Then we introduced a doubly-linked-list.

-------------------------------------------------------
Doubly Linked Lists
-------------------------------------------------------
Instead of just having a node pointing to the next node in order, we also have a pointer to the previous node too. We motivated this by examples of things like a 'Back' button in your browser, or an 'undo' button.

A standalone node now looks like this:
None<---[Value]--->None
An example of a doubly linked list is:
           --->	  --->
None<---[3]    [4]    [5]--->None
           <---   <---
-------------------------------------------------------

We can call head.next.next.prev to get the value of 4. Because we have head = [3], head.next = [4], and head.next.next = [5], then head.next.next.prev = [4].
